// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number
ask if number is divisible by 2 and whole number 
   if yes print even
   else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) ask for 5 differing numbers make them an array
b) add the numbers given in array together and divide by 5
    print result
    declare as average
c) print smallest integer in array
    declare as smallest
  then print highest integer in array
     declare as highest
d)print "the average of array is" + average
  print "the smallest number is" + smallest
  print "the highest number is" + highest
